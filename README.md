# OldFashonedBikeComputer
Bicycle computer like they don't make anymore. Distance &amp; cadence and a battery that lasts years.

## Overview
OldFashonedBikeComputer (OFBC) is a bicycle computer based on the STM32L031 mpu and a Sharp LS013B7DH03 display. It monitors distance travelled, cadence and temperature. It fits in a small (35mm by 55mm) case and will hopefully run for two years on a CR2032 coin cell.

### The State of This Project
I have built a unit and am using it on my bike. IT works "Good enough" for my requirements so I am moving on to other projects for now. A number of options are set the way I like them and can only be changed by re-compiling the firmware.

### To Do
* Larger screen.
* Switch to a processor with more flash (32k is barely enough).
* More configuration items (kilometres/miles, Celsuis/Farenheit, 12hr/24hr).
* New PCB with the mounting holes in the right place. Original pcb has been literally hacked to fit.
