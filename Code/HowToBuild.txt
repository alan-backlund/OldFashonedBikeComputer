Using STMicroelectronics STM32CubeIDE create a project based on the "Bike Computer Cpp.ioc" file.
Select the C++ target.
After the project has been created add the files in Inc, except for main.h, to the projects Core/Inc directory.
Add the files in Src, except for main.c, to the projects Core/Src directory.
Merge the main.h and main.c files with the files of the same name in the project.
Build the Release configuration.
The Debug configuration will not build because it is too large.
